                    <p>There are a few simple screens you will need to go through:</p>

                    <div class="number-circle">1</div>

                    <p>As you choose your benefits, you can select the RECALCULATE button to see how much they cost.</p>
                    <p>
                        If you’ve got flex credits left over, they will be allocated to your HCSA. You choose how many flex credits you want to keep in your HCSA or move to your Group RSP or Tax-Free Savings Account, or take as taxable cash!
