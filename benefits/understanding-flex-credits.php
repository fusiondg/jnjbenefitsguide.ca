                    </ul>

                    <p>You use flex credits to pay for extended medical care and dental care coverage. The higher the option you choose, the more flex credits you will use.</p>

                    <p>If you have flex credits left over after selecting your coverage options, you can put them in your Health Care Spending Account (HCSA), your Group RSP account or your Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA), or take them as taxable cash.</p>
